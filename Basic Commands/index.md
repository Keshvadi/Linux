## Introduction

**Note:** If you encounter a "command not found" error when attempting to run a command, it means the required program is not installed. In such cases, you need to install the program first. For example, to use 'wget,' which is needed to download sample files for testing commands, install it using the following command:

```bash
apt install wget -y
```

You will learn more about installing packages (programs) in a separate tutorial.

Additionally, to unzip a file, you can use the 'tar' command. If not already installed, install it with:

```bash
apt install tar -y
tar -xvf src.zip
```
