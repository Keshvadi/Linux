# Welcome to the Missing S.Eng Course!

Congratulations, and welcome to the **Missing S.Eng Course**!  

Think of this course as building your essential software engineering toolbox. This course handing you the **industry-standard tools** - the wrenches, screwdrivers, and multimeters of the software world - and showing you exactly how to use them. These are the same tools that practicing engineers rely on every single day.

Many students find themselves in a challenging position: They need co-op experience to graduate, but they haven't yet taken the courses that cover the skills employers are looking for. This course was originally designed to help them break that cycle.

## A Student-Run Initiative

What makes this course truly unique is that it's **student-run and non-credit**. This means, we've been in your shoes, and we know what skills are crucial for success. We're all learning together, and we encourage you to contribute your knowledge and experience. You can adjust the content and pace. The objective is to learn not to pass.


## What to Expect

This course is designed to be hands-on and engaging. We'll dive into essential technologies that are the bedrock of modern software development, including mastering the command line to unlock efficiency and control, essential for remote work, managing large files, and server administration. Then you will learn the Bash Scripting to automate repetitive tasks, streamline your workflow, and become a more efficient developer. Git and version control will be covered to collaborate seamlessly on projects, track changes, and understand the industry-standard version control system. Docker is use to package and deploy applications consistently across different environments to simplify development and deployment pipelines. You also will gain hands-on experience with cloud computing, a critical skill in today's cloud-first world. Web development essentials is also provided to get a head start on web technologies, making you a more competitive candidate for co-op positions. 

We also have a dedicated space (check out the **Contribution Guide** in the About section!) for you to ask questions, share resources, and help each other out.

## Let's Get Started!

We're excited to have you join us on this learning adventure.
