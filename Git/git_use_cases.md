## Git use Cases

1. **Track Changes in Your Code:**
    Git helps you save snapshots of your project as you work, so you can easily see what changed and when.

2. **Undo Mistakes:**
    Accidentally broke something? With Git, you can go back to a previous version of your code.

3. **Work with Branches:**
    Test new ideas in separate branches without affecting the main project. Once you're happy, merge the changes back.

4. **Offline Version Control:**
    Git works locally on your computer, so you can use it without an internet connection.

5. **Collaboration on Local Machines:**
    Share changes with teammates on a local network or through files, even if youâ€™re not using a cloud service.

6. **Code Merging:**
    Git allows you to combine changes from different contributors into one final version, handling conflicts if edits overlap.

## GitHub Use cases

1. **Store Code Online:**
    GitHub is like a cloud-based backup for your Git repositories. If your computer crashes, your code is safe online.

2. **Collaborate with Teams:**
    Share your repository with teammates to work together. Everyone can contribute, suggest changes, and review code.

3. **Showcase Your Work:**
    Use GitHub to show your projects to potential employers, clients, or collaborators as part of your portfolio.

4. **Remote Access:**
    Access your repositories from any device, anywhere in the world.

5. **Issue Tracking and Management:**
    Use GitHub to track bugs, tasks, or ideas and keep your project organized with built-in project boards.

6. **Integration with Tools:**
    GitHub integrates with CI/CD pipelines, project management tools, and more, allowing you to automate workflows and deployments.
