## Docker Use Cases

Here are some scenearios where you would use Docker

1. **Run Applications in Isolated Environments:**
   Docker lets you run apps in containers that are isolated from your main system. For example, you can run a Python web app in a container without worrying about messing up your computer’s settings or needing to install all the dependencies manually.

2. **Easy Setup for Development:**
   You can quickly set up a development environment for any application. For example, if you want to work on a Node.js project, you can use Docker to set up Node.js and all its dependencies, so you don’t need to install them on your computer.

3. **Testing Applications:**
   You can use Docker to test applications in different environments without installing new software. For example, if you want to test your app on both Ubuntu and Windows, you can use Docker to run both operating systems in containers on the same computer.

4. **Run Popular Software without Installing:**
   Docker allows you to run popular software like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, or Nginx without needing to install them on your computer. You can just pull a ready-to-use container from Docker Hub and run it right away.

5. **Share Projects with Others:**
   If you create a project and want others to run it, Docker makes it easy. You can package the entire project (with all its dependencies) into a container, and others can run it on their machines without worrying about missing libraries or software versions.

6. **Create Lightweight Virtual Environments:**
   Docker containers are much lighter than traditional virtual machines (VMs). You can quickly spin up a new environment to run an app or experiment with new tools without using up a lot of computer resources.
